                To wrap what has been a long 11 weeks of term, The ADM has teamed up with the other STEM societies to hold a ball
                to celebrate the achievements and hard work of all students in the field of STEM. We hope all involved have a relaxing
                break and enjoy the holidays. Thank you to all the societies that came together to make this event happen, to all the students
                who made the day that one bit more exciting.

                This year, ADM decided to switch things up and host the ADM Christmas quiz in UCL's Phineas Bar; Jai, Ezekiel, Sophie
                and Reka's team, Christmas Tree(3), won after a series of 4 tantalisingly difficult rounds with our biggest prize yet,
                a series of advent calangers and a light up snowman. We would also like to thank Professor Helen Wilson, Dr Ruth Reynolds
                and Dr Niki Kalaydzhieva for joining in with Veronica and Zsofi (mind you with a brilliant name '3 Brown 1 Blue'). Congratulations
                on the winner, and thank you all for taking part.

                The ADM are proud to announce that UCL has performed outstandingly in the national integration bee's first round; with
                a total of 18 students making 6 teams which have all scored higher than the lowest quartile of all competitors. Our highest
                team are one of only 2 teams to be on par with the top quartile of Cambridge. We are so proud of all the teams that took
                part, and wish those who have made it all the best for round 2 next term. Thank you all, and thank you to the Integration
                Bee team for providing us with this opportunity.

                The second of series of ADM academic competitions, the integration bee saw many students taking part in a challenging

                did not consider; and are excited to see what UCL has to offer for the National competition the week after. Thank you all
                for taking part, and congratulations to Travor Liu for scoring the top score, a whopping 79%.

                chess, coupled with biscuits and other treats. We would like to thank all those who joined, and to thank Eimear, for
                orchestrating the session with the ADM.

                This Halloween, the ADM celebrated by encouraging students to go to lectures in their best halloween costumes.
                The students came to UCL in costumes ranging from Luigi (also names Luigi) to Femboy maids. Students had blast
                taking pictures with each other. The year 2 students capped off their day by asking their lecturer to judge
                the best costume.

                Mathematics Competition. With a sizeable number of sign-ups, UCL maths students from almost all years worked hard
                for a gruelling 6 hours to complete a series of challenging questions; we are proud to announce that 'Franciszek Kobus'
                came out on top with a whopping score of 17; and their name sits proudly on the Simon Marais Website linked <a href="https://www.simonmarais.org/">

                where students relaxed, kicked back and had a last hoorah before starting the year up again.
