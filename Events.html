            The ADM is hosting an event with AmplifyMe. Come and Join!
            <br><br>
            AmplifyMe Simulation is a 2 hour session during which you will be able to learn about the financial industry and its different spheres. The programme will focus on Asset Management and Sales and Trading. During the first half the participants will be taught the basics of the two roles, to make sure that everyone, whether new to the finance world or not, is on the same level. Afterward, you will be able to apply your knowledge and gain practical experience by completing a simulation (for which a laptop is required). At the end your performance will be evaluated and the top performers will be fast-tracked directly to further training and internship opportunities with Morgan Stanley. Every participant will also be awarded a certificate.

                    As part of our aim to show that mathematics touches upon a vast range of subjects, and to shed light on the use of mathematics in lesser known areas. For our first talk we are collaborating with the Philosophy society, and have Professor Tim Button presenting:
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Stories about mathematical objects</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Here's a little story we might tell, about mathematical objects. There are certain objects, sets, also known as collections. Sets are identical just in case they have exactly the same members. Also – and this is important – sets are arranged in stages. Every set is found at some stage. At any stage S: for any sets found before S, we find a set whose members are exactly those sets. We find nothing else at S.

Questions involve: cryptic clues, riddles, passive memory, and anagrams. This is for everyone; so please do come along, maths students or not, and join us! After the success of our christmas pub quiz, we are looking forward to seeing more budding quiz experts tackle the problems we have prepared.

                    For our third academic competition the ADM decided to run a competition based on the famous UK game show Countdown! However, this time there was a twist. Contestants not only worked in integers, but with 3 dimensional vectors and gaussian integers, topped off with a prime factorisation as a conundrum. After a gruelling number of rounds, Maïlys came out with the most points and won the game!

                The Board game Social worked so well last term, that we decided to kick it off again this term! We had a range of students attending from 1st to 4th year. It served not only as an enjoyable activity before we get into the full swing of things for the year, but also as a way for the year 1 students to have a fun and relaxing break between their term 1 exams and their term 2 studies!

                To wrap what has been a long 11 weeks of term, The ADM has teamed up with the other STEM societies to hold a ball
                to celebrate the achievements and hard work of all students in the field of STEM. We hope all involved have a relaxing
                break and enjoy the holidays. Thank you to all the societies that came together to make this event happen, to all the students
                who made the day that one bit more exciting.

                a series of advent calanders and a light up snowman. We would also like to thank Professor Helen Wilson, Dr Ruth Reynolds
                and Dr Niki Kalaydzhieva with Veronica and Zsofi (mind you with a brilliant name '3 Brown 1 Blue') for coming

                team are one of only 2 teams to be on par with the top quartile of Cambridge. We are so proud of all the teams that took

                the best costume.

                The ADM Society are proud to kick off this academic year with a night of board games for all to enjoy!
                Students spent their time playing Family Fortunes, Chess, Pictionary and so much more! With a large turnout,
                this has been an excellent start, and a good omen for the events to come. Thank you all for taking part; we
                are so glad for the reception and the engangement from maths students and non-maths students alike.

                As a precursor for the start of the year, the ADM hosted a social at UCL's very own Huntley, where students
                met and engaged, giving advice for the year ahead and catching up on each other's Summers. It was an event
                where students relaxed, kicked back and had a last hoorah before starting the year up again.

                The Augustus De Morgan hosted a chess competition in the later weeks of term 2, which saw several
                students from the university's maths society competing against each other in six rounds of intense
                play.<br><br> Peter Koiza emerged as the undefeated champion, demonstrating exceptional skill and speed
                throughout the tournament. Congratulations to Peter for his impressive performance throughout the
                competition!
